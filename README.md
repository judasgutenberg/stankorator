This works like the Disturbatron to uncork various containers of fragrances and use a fan to quickly disperse them into the air nearby.  This could be used for good, I suppose, but my thinking is that it would likely be used mostly for evil. If you need to send smells to someone, what is the likelihood they're going to be pleasant?
